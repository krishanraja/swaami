# Swaami Value Proposition

## One-Liner

**Swaami connects verified neighbors for quick, safe micro-help within walking distance.**

## The Problem

### For Help-Seekers
- Traditional platforms are anonymous and risky
- Asking friends/family feels burdensome for small tasks
- Gig services are expensive for 15-minute tasks
- No easy way to find trusted neighbors

### For Helpers
- Want to contribute to community but lack opportunities
- Have spare moments but not hours to volunteer
- Don't know who nearby needs help
- Worried about safety when helping strangers

### For Communities
- Urban isolation despite physical proximity
- Neighborly trust declining
- No infrastructure for micro-help exchange
- Over-reliance on commercial services

## The Solution

### Swaami provides:

1. **Trust First**
   - Three-tier verification (email → phone/social → full verification)
   - Visible trust badges on every profile
   - Safety filters on all content

2. **Hyperlocal Focus**
   - 50-800m radius matching
   - Walk, don't drive
   - Same neighborhood = same community

3. **Micro-Task Design**
   - 45-minute maximum tasks
   - Quick posts, quick matches
   - AI enhancement for clear task descriptions

4. **Reciprocal Community**
   - Help others, build reputation
   - Credit system for balanced exchange
   - Streak rewards for consistent participation
