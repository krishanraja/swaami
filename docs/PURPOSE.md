# Swaami Purpose & Values

## Mission

**Build hyper-local networks of reciprocal help that make neighbourhoods more connected, resilient, and kind.**

## The Problem We Solve

Modern life has made neighbours strangers. People live next to each other for years without ever exchanging more than a nod. When someone needs a small favor—carrying groceries up stairs, help with a phone, someone to walk their dog—they often have no one to ask.

Meanwhile, many people would happily help if they just knew someone needed it.

Swaami bridges this gap.

## Core Values

### 1. Neighbours, Not Strangers
We're not an anonymous gig platform. Every interaction builds real community relationships. We encourage repeat pairing ("circuits") so people develop trusted connections.

### 2. Reciprocity, Not Charity
Everyone both gives and receives help. Credits ensure balance—you help others, you can get help yourself. No one is "the helper" and no one is "the needy."

### 3. Micro, Not Major
Small tasks under 45 minutes. Carrying bags, setting up devices, feeding a pet. These are the building blocks of community trust. We're not replacing professional services.

### 4. Walking Distance, Not City-Wide
500m radius by default. If you can walk there in 5 minutes, you're neighbours. Hyper-local density creates real community, not dispersed transactions.

### 5. Safety First, Always
Every feature decision considers: could this enable harm? We block risky content, encourage public meetings, and never reveal exact addresses until a match is confirmed.

### 6. Simple, Not Clever
One feed. One button to help. One chat. We resist feature creep. Every addition must earn its place by making core interactions better.

## What Swaami Is NOT

- **Not a gig platform**: No payments, no "workers", no ratings that feel like performance reviews
- **Not a charity app**: Everyone participates equally, no donors and recipients
- **Not a social network**: No feeds, followers, likes, or endless scrolling
- **Not a marketplace**: No buying, selling, or commercial transactions

## Success Metrics

We measure success by:
1. **Active neighbourhoods**: Areas with consistent weekly activity
2. **Reciprocity rate**: % of users who both give and receive help
3. **Circuit formation**: Repeat pairings between same neighbours
4. **Task completion rate**: Started tasks that reach completion
5. **Safety incidents**: Target: Zero

## Design Principles

### Every screen should answer: "What can I do right now?"
No confusion about actions. Clear primary buttons. Obvious next steps.

### Trust is earned through transparency
Show reliability scores, task counts, and how long someone has been a neighbour.

### Reduce friction at every step
AI writes your task. One tap to help. Quick status updates. Minimal typing.

### Delight in small moments
Celebrate completions. Acknowledge milestones. Make helping feel good.

## The Future We're Building

A neighbourhood where:
- Anyone can ask for help without shame
- Everyone has skills someone needs
- Trust grows through small acts
- Loneliness decreases
- Resilience increases
- Community becomes real again

*Swaami exists because we believe technology should bring neighbours together, not keep them apart.*
